# Notes on Final Report

The Final report is written in LaTeX.
While the .tex document and a corresponding PDF are stored here on Github, its easiest to just copy the code to whatever environment you want to use if you want to edit it and recompile the pdf. overleaf is a great website to do this.

Mario is happy to be responsible for the latex side of things for this. Any content you wanna add, discussion or other stuff relevant to the Final Report can be done on the google drive.
